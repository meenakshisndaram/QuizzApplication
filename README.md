#QUIZZAPPLICATION
I have developed this QuizzApplication Project by using  SpringBootApplication.                                          For that first, I have created a SpringBootApplication and the required class for it and have an individual package for its respective classes like CONTROLLER, DAO, MODEL, and SERVICES.                           
After that, I connect the MYSQL by providing the valid configurations in the application.properties.      
And have coded for the required  HTTP methods.                                                                                              And have tested via Postman.
